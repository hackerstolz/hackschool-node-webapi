Code me! 
========

This is the place where the code needs to go.

The following routes need to be implemented. All routes must return a HTTP Status Code 200 when successful, otherwise 500.

GET api/customer/list
-----------------

Returns a JSON object with a list of customers like this:

[
	{
		"id": 1,
		"firstName": "Max",
		"lastName": "Mustermann"
	},
	{
		"id": 2,
		"firstName": "John",
		"lastName": "Doe"
	}
]


POST api/customer
-----------------

Creates a new customer. The frontend will submit a JSON object in the request body containing the following object:

{
	"firstName": "Maria",
	"lastName": "Musterfrau"
}

DELETE api/customer/:id
-----------------------

Removes the customer identified by :id.
